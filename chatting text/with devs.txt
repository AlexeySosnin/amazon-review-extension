Just one review?

Tam, 3:52 AM
just received it

3:54 AM
I wonder if why there is only one keyword from the many reviews...

Tam, 3:57 AM
as I said

it splits sentence to words then assess it's polarity

@Ng?c pls check if you sent the reviews correctly

I will try to improve the nlp algorigthm

@ALex You can take a look at the nlp engine in `app/api/backend.py`

I use textblob lib btw

I can't find the app/api/backend.py. Can you send me the source here?

Tam, 4:08 AM
Did you save the project github source code link?

4:09 AM

Tam, 4:10 AM

Hello
How is going our project?

Ng?c, 8:36 AM
@Tam 


Just one review?
ALex, Yesterday at 3:52 AM
Because it only has 1 review 3 star rate and no reviews in 1 or 2 star rate


Ng?c, 9:29 AM

But we definitely still want to analyze the sentiment. But I'm just thinking if it's a better product if we use the sentiment analysis to decide which is a negative review and then just take the most popular keywords from those negative reviews
ALex, Thursday at 4:54 PM
@ALex Do you mean we will send all the reviews instead of 1,2,3 star reviews to analyze then extract the popular keywords?

12:30 PM
okay, let me think

Hi, now I am going to Yekaterinbrug
Can you also include some quick instructions on accessing the nltk python? Is it just on the ec2 instance home?

I will contact you with other skype address and my name. Then accept me and let's continue to work. 
I hope you are going well.
Beauty Linh and handsome Tam. Best regard.
