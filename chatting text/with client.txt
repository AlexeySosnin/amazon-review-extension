1) We need to also add keywords on the product's detail page. Like this page: https://www.amazon.com/LannaPremium-Fisherman-Pants-Trousers-Cotton/dp/B00LE4ZJWA

- So do you have a design for it? Let address where you want to see

Amazon.com
https://www.amazon.com
2) When I close the plugin and reopen it again on the same page, it stops working (see picture). 
=> When you close and reopen, the plugin can't continue work because the popup only is active when it's open and it reset the state of loading products.
 So I am thinking about the solution.

Sure, I can send a rough mockup


Renaud, 10:43 PM


And then if you click on the plugin while in this page, it will only show you information on the one product

Okay

Check this last version

Renaud, 5:01 PM
Perfect, I'll check it out asap


Renaud, 6:01 PM


The latest version looks good! One last little detail: can we add a title at the top of the keywords here? Just "Negative Keywords" would be fine


Renaud, 6:09 PM
Also, how can I access the web_api directly if I wanted to make changes to the nltk python or blacklist? I think you guys set up two new instances on AWS so how can I log in?

7:29 PM
You're using Windows?
7:40 PM
I will make you guide as the video record.

Renaud, 9:45 PM
Nah, I'm using Mac

Mac OSX

It is guide
5:10 PM
Hello, how are you today?
5:15 PM
Did you checked the new version?

Renaud, 6:39 PM
Hey Alexey, I'm good. How are you?

I'm checking out the new version this morning


Renaud, 6:53 PM
It looks good but the nltk python still seems a little off sometimes. Like the only keyword that appears here is "green"... Why?

Also, can you send over the "web_api.pem" file? And can you add instructions on how to access the nltk python engine?


3:45 AM

web_api.pem
It is the perm file.

Renaud, 5:43 PM
Thanks

Can you also include some quick instructions on accessing the nltk python? Is it just on the ec2 instance home?

12:59 AM

Now I am developing safari version
ALex, Today at 1:07 AM
Also, don't develop the Safari version just yet. I want to get the nltk python working properly for the keywords first on Chrome

We can talk more when you get back

1:21 AM
Okay, sure.

;-)
Renaud Beaupre, Today at 1:20 AM
Can you send me the screenshot?
